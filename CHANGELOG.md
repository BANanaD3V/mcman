## 0.4.0

- ‚ö° New `server/.mcman.lock` file containing metadata about the last build. This file will be used ( if it exists ) to validate and skip files that do not need to be downloaded or bootstrapped again (making builds get a lot faster)

- üì¶ New global **caching** most downloaded files and useful metadata will be cached under these directories:
  - Windows: `%localappdata%/mcman`
  - Linux: `~/.cache/mcman` (most likely)

- :octocat: Fixed **Github rate limiting** <sup>(unless you have like a billion `ghrel`'s).</sup> 
    
    - Because of the caching system, metadata from GitHub get cached. `mcman` can use this metadata to send *conditional requests* which do not count towards the rate limit. You can also provide a token by setting `sources.github.api_token` in the config or using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

- üîí File **hash checksums** are also implemented, meaning more secure and stable downloads. (Yes, cached files also get checked)

- üìú **Visual overhaul**: `mcman`'s got a new look. There are now progress bars and spinners everywhere, and its more consistent overall.

- ‚òî **Hot reloading** with development sessions, you can develop your server without having to build it every time you change something!

- üåê **Worlds** You can now download (in `server.toml`) and store (`worlds/`) worlds!

- ‚òï **Java environment variables** You can now set the java version to use (`server.toml`) and mcman will use `JAVA_*_BIN` variables to find and use the java with the version

- ‚ú® **Networks** Have multiple servers? `network.toml` is now here! Have common addons, common configs and variables! It can also help you manage port configurations with special variables like `${NETWORK_VELOCITY_SERVERS}`

- üìé **mclo.gs** `mcman run` and `mcman dev` can auto-upload logs to [mclo.gs](mclo.gs)
    
    - enable it by setting env var `upload_to_mclogs` to `true` or setting `services.mclogs.enabled=true` in config

- üß∞ An experimental `.mcman.toml` config file was added (will be looked in current directory and your home config directory)
