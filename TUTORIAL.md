## Create your first server

1. Create a folder (optionally also initialize a git repository)

2. Run `mcman init --name <server name>`, or just `mcman init` to name the server as the folder name

3. You can edit the server configuration in `server.toml` or use mcman in the terminal to edit it.

4. Let's set the server to use [Paper](https://papermc.io/) - run `mcman set server paper`
