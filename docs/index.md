## About

`mcman` allows you to:

- Have a single `server.toml` for auto-updating plugins/mods, the server jar, worlds, etc...
- get rid of the hassle of downloading and dragging over jar files,
- efficiently write config files using config and environment variables,
- use `git` for your servers to be able to version control and collaborate,
- render markdown about the server
- test if the server works using CI
- and more!

`mcman` is not great for:

- Creating clientside modpacks or modpacks to only publish them (use [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) for that)
